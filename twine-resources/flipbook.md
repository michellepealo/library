## Overview

This book is meant to be a quick reference for specific skills in [Twine](https://twinery.org), a text-based coding tool for creating web-based interactive stories. This book is written for the Chapbook Twine story format, which we selected for its low barriers to entry and ease of use with students and novice programmers.
