## Summary

In this lesson, students explore the basics of artificial intelligence (AI) and (ML), focusing on the biases that can arise in AI models and the ethical considerations involved in their development and use. Through hands-on activities using Teachable Machine, students will create their own AI models, analyze the biases present, and discuss strategies to mitigate these biases. The lesson emphasizes the importance of fairness and justice in AI systems and encourages students to reflect on the societal impact of biased AI. 

## Objectives

*The students will be able to . . .*

* Give a basic, high-level explanation of how artificial intelligence and machine learning works.
* Create a machine learning model using Teachable Machine. 
* Identify and analyze biases present in AI models.
* Evaluate the ethical considerations and justice issues involved in developing and using ML models.
* Discuss strategies to mitigate biases in AI models.
* Reflect on the societal impact of biased AI systems.
