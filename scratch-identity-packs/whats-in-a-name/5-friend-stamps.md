## Summary

In this lesson, students will code along with the teacher as they learn about recording and playing sounds, changing costumes, and broadcasting events to trigger actions in a Scratch program. Guided by the teacher, students will modify an interactive starter project to display the word “friend” in multiple languages and erase the screen. You can skip this lesson and move on to “Pronouncing Names from Around the World” (Lesson 6) if students have already mastered these Scratch coding skills.
