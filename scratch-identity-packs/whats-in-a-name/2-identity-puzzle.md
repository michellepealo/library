## Summary

In this lesson, students will analyze a premade Scratch project inspired by the main character in the book *Calvin* and annotate code blocks in the project code to explain how the project works. This analysis will prepare them with computer science skills in order to create their own Scratch project in future lessons, using the PRIMM model of CS education (Predict, Run, Investigate, Modify, Make). You can skip this lesson and move on to the Social-Emotional Reflection and Scratch Project Lesson Plan if students have already mastered these Scratch coding skills.

Lesson 2 of 7 in the [What’s in a Name? Lesson Sequence](/library/browse/scratch-identity-packs/whats-in-a-name), as part of the [Scratch Identity Packs](/library/browse/scratch-identity-packs) project.
