## Summary

In this lesson, students learn fundamental coding skills on the Micro\:Bit, specifically focusing on conditionals, variables and  randomization. Through hands-on activities, students will learn to modify and create programs, establishing a foundation for upcoming lessons on conditionals. 

## Objectives

*The students will be able to . . .*

- Apply the concept of variables on the Micro\:Bit, recognizing their role in storing and manipulating data.
- Use randomization in their Micro\:Bit programs.
- Establish connections between input/event blocks and variables, enabling the creation of interactive programs.
