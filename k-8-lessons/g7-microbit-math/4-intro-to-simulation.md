## Summary

In this lesson, students learn about simulations and how they are used. They conduct an experiment and compare their results using a bar graph. Students describe their outcomes  using pre-requisite vocabulary and plan English—in a future lesson, they will convert their English descriptions into mathematical calculations. 

## Objectives

*The students will be able to . . .*

- Define “simulation”
- Create and compare bar charts of results
- Modify code involving random number generation and conditional control structures
- Compare experimental and simulated outcomes
