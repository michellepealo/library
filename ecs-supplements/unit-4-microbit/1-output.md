## Summary

In this lesson, students learn the basics of coding for the Micro:Bit using the MakeCode development tool. Students will engage in PRIMM cycles, pair programming, and will begin working on the puzzle box they’ll finish in later lessons by building an “unlocking” animation using display output blocks.

## Objectives

*The students will be able to...*

- Define “computing device”, “hardware”, “software”, and “microcontroller”
- Identify computing devices based on the IPOS (input, processing, output, storage) model
- Read, trace, debug, and write MakeCode and Micro:Bit programs that use display commands and the “on-start” and “forever” event blocks.
